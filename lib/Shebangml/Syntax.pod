=head1 NAME

Shebangml/Syntax.pod - about the #!ml syntax

=head1 Basics

Shebangml is a human-writable syntax for xml.  Unlike YAML, HAML, and
various other shorthands, it directly expresses the xml structure (nodes
have attributes and/or content), 

  node{The content goes here}

  node[with="just attributes"]

  node[with=attribute]{and content!}

The syntax is just that, and not much more.

=head1 Shortcuts

As you may have noticed, attributes do not need to be quoted if they
have no spaces or special characters.

=head2 Entities

  '\n;' => '<br/>'

=head2 Attributes

These commonly used attributes may be shortened as long as the value is
a simple string and all shortcuts occur before any full attributes.

  '=foo' => 'id="foo"'
  ':foo' => 'name="foo"'
  '@foo' => 'class="foo"'

=head1 Verbatim Quoting

The content of an element surrounded with {{{ and }}} will be passed
through without parsing.  This can be done on a single line or as
start/end tokens for a multiline block.

  whatever{{{ no parsing in{here} at all }}}

  whatever{{{
    Or some multiline thing, but you have to stop this section at the
    beginning of the line.
  }}}
